# Interactive 3D Car Configurator Project Plan

## Step 1: Project Setup

1. Create a new React project using Vite
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei 
   ```
3. Set up Tailwind CSS https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite


## Step 2: Basic 3D Scene Setup
https://threejs.org/examples/?q=car#webgl_materials_car
1. Create a new component for the 3D scene (e.g., `CarScene.jsx`)
2. Set up a basic Three.js scene using React Three Fiber
3. Add orbit controls and a camera

## Step 3: Load and Display 3D Car Model

1. Find or create a 3D car model (e.g., in .glb format)
https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
2. Use `useLoader` from React Three Fiber to load the model
3. Display the model in your scene

## Step 4: Implement Color Customization

1. Create a color picker component 
2. Add state management for the selected color (using React hooks)
3. Apply the selected color to the car model using Three.js materials

## Step 5: Add Wheel Customization

1. Create separate 3D models for different wheel types
2. Implement a wheel selection UI using Tailwind CSS
3. Update the car model to display the selected wheels

## Step 6: Lighting and Environment

1. Add environment lighting to enhance the 3D rendering
2. Implement HDR background for realistic reflections
3. Add adjustable spotlights to highlight the car

## Step 7: Camera Controls and Animations

1. Implement preset camera positions (e.g., front view, side view)
2. Add smooth transitions between camera positions
3. Create an auto-rotate feature for the car


## Step 9: Additional Features

1. Add a feature to change interior colors or materials
2. Implement a screenshot or sharing functionality
3. Create an information panel displaying car specifications

## Step 10: Performance Optimization

1. Implement lazy loading for 3D models and textures
2. Use React.memo and useMemo to optimize component rendering
3. Add loading indicators and placeholders


## Step 11: Deployment and Documentation

1. Build the project for production
2. Deploy to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
3. Write documentation for future maintenance and updates
